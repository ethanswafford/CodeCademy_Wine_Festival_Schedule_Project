# CodeCademy_Wine_Festival_Schedule_Project
Wine Festival Schedule  The Aguillar Family is hosting their annual wine festival and they have asked you to build a web page for the event schedule! Use your knowledge of HTML to display a table to the attendees.

Let’s begin!

Code review available when you’re done.



In index.html, inside of the <div> element that has the attribute class with a value of "container", create a new <table> element.

Inside of the <table> element, add a section for table headings using <thead>.

Then, add two rows inside of it using the table row element.

Inside the first table row element, from task 2, add a table heading element.

Inside of that, include an <h1> with the following text: Wine Festival Schedule.

Inside the second table row element, from task 2, add two <th>s:

    In the first, add an <h2> that says Time.

    In the second, add an <h2> that says Event.

You may notice that “Wine Festival Schedule” does not stretch across the entire table. Let’s fix that!

In the opening <th> tag of this element, add colspan="2".

Below the closing </thead> tag, section off the table using the table body element.

Inside of the table body you created in the previous task, create 5 rows using the table row element.

Inside each row, create two cells using the table data element.

The first table data in each row should have the attribute class with the value "left".

Inside each of the 5 <td class="left"> elements, add <h3> elements that include the times of the events:

    12:00 PM
    01:00 PM
    02:00 PM
    03:00 PM
    04:00 PM


Feel free to look back at the live site to compare.

Inside each of the <td> elements that does not have a class attribute with a value of "left", add <h3> elements that include the name of events:

    Welcome Reception
    Storytelling & Tasting
    Wine Luncheon
    Aguillar Family Wines
    Wine & Cheese Tasting

You have created the events table. Cheers!
